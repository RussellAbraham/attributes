    <p>CodeMirror is a code-editor component that can be embedded in
    Web pages. The core library provides <em>only</em> the editor
    component, no accompanying buttons, auto-completion, or other IDE
    functionality. It does provide a rich API on top of which such
    functionality can be straightforwardly implemented. See
    the <a href="#addons">addons</a> included in the distribution,
    and the <a href="https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/wiki/CodeMirror-addons">list
    of externally hosted addons</a>, for reusable
    implementations of extra features.</p>

    <p>CodeMirror works with language-specific modes. Modes are
    JavaScript programs that help color (and optionally indent) text
    written in a given language. The distribution comes with a number
    of modes (see the <a href="../mode/"><code>mode/</code></a>
    directory), and it isn't hard to <a href="#modeapi">write new
    ones</a> for other languages.</p>
