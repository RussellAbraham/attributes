    <h2>Customized Styling</h2>

    <p>Up to a certain extent, CodeMirror's look can be changed by
    modifying style sheet files. The style sheets supplied by modes
    simply provide the colors for that mode, and can be adapted in a
    very straightforward way. To style the editor itself, it is
    possible to alter or override the styles defined
    in <a href="../lib/codemirror.css"><code>codemirror.css</code></a>.</p>

    <p>Some care must be taken there, since a lot of the rules in this
    file are necessary to have CodeMirror function properly. Adjusting
    colors should be safe, of course, and with some care a lot of
    other things can be changed as well. The CSS classes defined in
    this file serve the following roles:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt id="class_CodeMirror"><code><strong>CodeMirror</strong></code></dt>
      <dd>The outer element of the editor. This should be used for the
      editor width, height, borders and positioning. Can also be used
      to set styles that should hold for everything inside the editor
      (such as font and font size), or to set a background. Setting
      this class' <code>height</code> style to <code>auto</code> will
      make the editor <a href="../demo/resize.html">resize to fit its
      content</a> (it is recommended to also set
      the <a href="#option_viewportMargin"><code>viewportMargin</code>
      option</a> to <code>Infinity</code> when doing this.</dd>

      <dt id="class_CodeMirror_focused"><code><strong>CodeMirror-focused</strong></code></dt>
      <dd>Whenever the editor is focused, the top element gets this
      class. This is used to hide the cursor and give the selection a
      different color when the editor is not focused.</dd>

      <dt id="class_CodeMirror_gutters"><code><strong>CodeMirror-gutters</strong></code></dt>
      <dd>This is the backdrop for all gutters. Use it to set the
      default gutter background color, and optionally add a border on
      the right of the gutters.</dd>

      <dt id="class_CodeMirror_linenumbers"><code><strong>CodeMirror-linenumbers</strong></code></dt>
      <dd>Use this for giving a background or width to the line number
      gutter.</dd>

      <dt id="class_CodeMirror_linenumber"><code><strong>CodeMirror-linenumber</strong></code></dt>
      <dd>Used to style the actual individual line numbers. These
      won't be children of the <code>CodeMirror-linenumbers</code>
      (plural) element, but rather will be absolutely positioned to
      overlay it. Use this to set alignment and text properties for
      the line numbers.</dd>

      <dt id="class_CodeMirror_lines"><code><strong>CodeMirror-lines</strong></code></dt>
      <dd>The visible lines. This is where you specify vertical
      padding for the editor content.</dd>

      <dt id="class_CodeMirror_cursor"><code><strong>CodeMirror-cursor</strong></code></dt>
      <dd>The cursor is a block element that is absolutely positioned.
      You can make it look whichever way you want.</dd>

      <dt id="class_CodeMirror_selected"><code><strong>CodeMirror-selected</strong></code></dt>
      <dd>The selection is represented by <code>span</code> elements
      with this class.</dd>

      <dt id="class_CodeMirror_matchingbracket"><code><strong>CodeMirror-matchingbracket</strong></code>,
        <code><strong>CodeMirror-nonmatchingbracket</strong></code></dt>
      <dd>These are used to style matched (or unmatched) brackets.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>If your page's style sheets do funky things to
    all <code>div</code> or <code>pre</code> elements (you probably
    shouldn't do that), you'll have to define rules to cancel these
    effects out again for elements under the <code>CodeMirror</code>
    class.</p>

    <p>Themes are also simply CSS files, which define colors for
    various syntactic elements. See the files in
    the <a href="../theme/"><code>theme</code></a> directory.</p>
