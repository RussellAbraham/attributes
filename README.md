Try the library right here in this **live code editor**. This is an example of an [editable embed](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/pro-features/editable-embeds/), a feature of CodePen.

## Installation

storage.js is not available on npm, so you can't:

```bash
npm i storage-library --save-dev
# or
yarn add storage-library
```

Then use it in your JavaScript like:

```javascript
import library from "JavaScriptLibrary";
```

Or you can load it from a CDN like:

```html
<script src="https://storage-library.min.js"></script>
```

Which gives you a `library` global.
